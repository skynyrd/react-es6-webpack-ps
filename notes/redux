Three Principles of Redux

1. One immutable store: State can't be changed.
2. Actions trigger changes.
3. State is changed by pure functions: Reducers.

Flux vs Redux

Similarities:
  Data down. Actions up.
  Unidirectional Flow (One Way).
  Actions.
  Stores.

Differences:
  Reducers of Redux
  Containers of Redux
  Immutability of Redux

Flux: Stores contain state and change logic.
Redux: Store and change logic are separate.

Flux: Multiple stores
Redux: One store

Flux: Flat and disconnected stores.
Redux: Single store with hierarchical reducers.

Flux: Singleton dispatcher
Redux: No dispatcher

Flux: React components subscribe to stores
Redux: Container components utilize connect (React Redux)

Flux: State is mutated
Redux: State is immutable
